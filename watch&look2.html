    <h1>JODI.org</h1>
    <p>This website is interesting, because each tap can top up different website show different items. <br><br>For example, when i first tap this website, it show two people images on the screen, these two people are in black and white background, when my cursor tap the people image, its top up a GIF page, each people hold on the box and seems doing exercise. The size is becoming smaller, but the quantity is increasing. 
        <br><br>When I second tap this website, it also can link to a video. Music is very fun and lively. Like game music and video.</p>
