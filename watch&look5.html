    <p>This is not a responsive website. 

        <br><br>Through check the website, I find three main color palette. These are: purple, blue, black.
        
        <br><br>Interactive elements: 1. mouse: when the mouse move turn to left, the size of the object will become more and more smaller; when the mouse move turn to right, the size of the object will become more and more bigger. 2. sound and colour: the sound and colour play together that looks rhythm. These function can user immersive into this web installation.</p>
        <p>Reason: I like this website so much because its creative design and great techniques.</p>
