    <h1>Harold Cohen's Drawing Machines</h1>
    <p>Cohen built his own plotters and painting machines. 

        <br><br>This interprets computer commands to make line drawings on paper and automated add color with brushes.</p>
        <p>Reason: I like this machine so much because it is convenient and has beautiful drawings.</p>
