    <p>This website is not a responsive website. 

        <br><br>Through check the website, I find many color palette. These are red, yellow, green, and purple.
        
        <br><br>Interactive elements: 1. font: when the mouse click it, many glimmers can form or breakdrown a text. 2. cursor control: when mouse click it in a stable way, it will stop the animation. These function can make user feel this fancy website.</p>
        <p>Reason: I like this website so much because its form, and function of the art.</p>
