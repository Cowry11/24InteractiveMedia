    <h1>DIY Flex Sensor</h1>
    <p>This webpage is about how to self-make a flex sensor in your home. The materials used are 2 cardboard strips, a paper strip, 2 foil strips, glue, a pencil, and 2 small jumper wires. When this sensor is made, it connects to the LED. The LED will react according to the sensors's degree of bend. I prefer this physical computing example because it is a basic experiment I can learn from without spending money.</p>
